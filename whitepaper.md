# RIGGED Token: It’s Time to Embrace the Truth

## Everything is RIGGED

- GME never mooned because Robinhood flipped the kill switch.
- Politics are rigged. Congress trades on insider info and mints eight-figure fortunes from six-figure salaries.
- Sports are rigged. Especially when your team loses. That holding call? Rigged.
- Job interviews? Boss’s nephew got the role before you even applied.
- Token launches? If you’re not first (you’re never first), you’re dumped on.  
It’s all one big casino and the house always wins.

## Please Do Not Buy This Token

Seriously. $RIGGED contributes absolutely no value to society. It will not moon. You won’t get rich. You will imagine a yacht. There will be no yacht.  
Bots will poach the float. The Dev wallet gets 1% on every trade because it’s RIGGED. The Dev looks forward to owning millions of worthless tokens, eventually discarded on the infinite trash pile of pointless meme tokens that offered nothing and expected everything.  
This is not financial advice. It’s barely advice.
